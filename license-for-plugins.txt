For the purpose of creating plugins, anyone is hereby allowed to freely copy,
modify, embed, redistribute, sublicense and sell copies of the source code of
the root directory (licensed under the AGPL-3.0-only - see `LICENSE.txt`) and
`src/` and `assets/` folders, *excluding* the subfolders in `src/` and also
*excluding* all files in `assets/images/external/`.

You may include the source code of the BetterYTM project in the source of yours,
as long as only the above mentioned files are included in the *runtime* code that
will be distributed to the end user. (For development purposes *only*, you may
include and use the entire source code of this project.)

Additionally, you are to make the source code of your plugin available to anyone
so they may check it for security and legitimacy. And you are also obligated to
provide a link to said source code in the plugin definition object used in the
registration of the plugin at runtime (see contributing.md).

Lastly, your plugin is to follow the local laws and regulations of the country
you are in, and you are to take full responsibility for any legal issues that may
arise from the use of your plugin.

Use is granted under the condition that the original author and the BetterYTM
project is credited in the plugin, in a place that is easily accessible to the
end user. This can be done by including a link to the BetterYTM project in a
dialog in the plugin's runtime code or by putting it in its readme or similar.

Failure to comply with these terms will mean your plugin won't be endorsed by the
BetterYTM project and could, in severe cases, even result in legal action being
taken against you and your plugin.
