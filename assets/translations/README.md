## BetterYTM - Translations
To submit or edit a translation, please follow [this guide](../../contributing.md#submitting-translations)

<br>

### Translation progress:
| Locale | Translated keys | Based on |
| ------ | --------------- | :------: |
| `en_US` | 120 (default locale) |  |
| `de_DE` | ðŸš« `97/120` (80.8%) | â”€ |
| `en_UK` | âœ… `120/120` (100.0%) | `en_US` |
| `es_ES` | ðŸš« `97/120` (80.8%) | â”€ |
| `fr_FR` | ðŸš« `97/120` (80.8%) | â”€ |
| `hi_IN` | ðŸš« `97/120` (80.8%) | â”€ |
| `ja_JA` | ðŸš« `97/120` (80.8%) | â”€ |
| `pt_BR` | ðŸš« `97/120` (80.8%) | â”€ |
| `zh_CN` | ðŸš« `97/120` (80.8%) | â”€ |

<br>

If a translation is based on another translation, that means the keys from the base translation file are automatically applied if they are missing. This is used for locales that are very similar to each other, such as `en_UK` and `en_US`  
This means you need to manually check against the base translations for missing keys if you want to improve translations.

| `feature_helptext_logLevel` | `This is really only needed for debugging purposes. If you have a problem with the userscript, you should set this to a verbose setting so you can include the JavaScript console log in your GitHub issue.` |
