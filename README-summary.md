### Features:
All of these can be toggled and configured in the configuration menu.
- Layout & User Experience:
  - Show the approximate amount of likes and dislikes on songs (powered by returnyoutubedislike.com)
  - Open any song's lyrics on genius.com which generally has higher quality than YouTube's providers
  - Quick actions on songs in a queue, to quickly open their lyrics or remove them from the queue
  - Quickly scroll to the currently active song in the queue by clicking a button
  - Set a custom size and step resolution for the volume slider and show a percentage label next to it
  - Remember the time of the last played song to resume playback after reloading or reopening the tab
  - Improve clickability of song titles and thumbnails when wanting to open them in a new tab
  - Remove the tracking parameter from URLs in the share menu
  - Automatically close permanent notifications
- Input & Interaction:
  - Auto-like songs and videos of your favorite creators on both YouTube and YouTube Music
  - Use arrow keys to skip forward or backward by a configurable amount of time
  - Press number keys to skip to a percentage of the currently playing song
  - Press a hotkey on a video/song to switch between YouTube and YouTube Music, while keeping the video time
  - Prevent the "unsaved data" popup that sometimes appears before leaving the site
  
... and these are just the notable features, there are many more smaller features, improvements and fixes!

## Installation:
Note: by installing BetterYTM, you agree to the [license terms](./LICENSE.txt), [disclaimers](#disclaimers) and [privacy notice.](#privacy)
1. **Install a userscript manager browser extension - I really recommend Violentmonkey ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag), [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/violentmonkey/eeagobfjdenkkddmbclomhiblgggliao?hl=en-GB&gl=DE)).**  
  <sub>Other extensions are known to not work as expected, especially in isolated contexts like with FireMonkey or the Brave browser (<a href="https://github.com/Sv443/BetterYTM/issues/115#issuecomment-2468374348" target="_blank">more info here</a>).</sub>

2. **Then, [visit the Releases page](https://github.com/Sv443/BetterYTM/releases) and click the install button on the latest release.**  
  <sub>Note: the `unsafeWindow` grant is required due to limitations in some browsers (<a href="https://github.com/Sv443/BetterYTM/issues/18#show_issue" target="_blank">more info here</a>).</sub>

<br>
  
If you want to install the latest (potentially unstable) development build, [look for the latest pull request](https://github.com/Sv443/BetterYTM/pulls?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Apr+is%3Aopen) and click the install button there.  
Please make sure to manually remove and reinstall the userscript once the next release is out to avoid any issues.

<br><br><br>

## Privacy:
BetterYTM does not collect any data about you that isn't strictly necessary for its features to work.  
Your userscript manager extension's storage API is used to store all settings and data locally on your device.  
Open its settings to see and manage this data or remove the userscript to automatically delete all data.  
  
BetterYTM makes use of external services and APIs to provide some of its features, which may collect data about you.  
In every case, only the bare minimum of data is sent to these services and only when necessary.  
This data includes the version of the userscript, your IP address, and the ID, title and author of the video you're watching.
