## src/menu/
This directory contains the code of the now somewhat legacy config menu.  
It's jankily made to barely work in conjunction with the new BytmDialog instances.  
To be fully compatible and reduce developer overhead in the long term it will need to be migrated sooner or later, probably as part of a bigger config menu overhaul.
