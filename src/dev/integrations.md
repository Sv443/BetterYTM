## Integrations with other extensions and tools
BetterYTM integrates with other extensions and tools to provide a smoother experience:
- (Any other userscript)
  - BYTM has a plugin system that allows users to write their own userscripts to extend the functionality of BYTM and benefit from its APIs
- [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/)
  - BYTM disables the extension entirely in YTM because the site doesn't even have a light theme
  - Dark Reader is disabled for some elements, as it breaks BYTM's precise styling
- [Enhancer for YouTube](https://www.mrfdev.com/enhancer-for-youtube)
  - BYTM integrates the set theme in its own UI elements on YT
- [Return YouTube Dislike](https://returnyoutubedislike.com/)
  - BYTM shows the like and dislike counts of songs on YTM
  - This functionality is also exposed on the interface for plugins to use
- [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/)
  - The SponsorBlock popup had to have its positioning adjusted so that it works better with BYTM's and YTM's UI
- [ThemeSong](https://github.com/KristofferTroncoso/ThemeSong)
  - BYTM automatically adjusts its colors to fit the selected theme in ThemeSong on YTM
  - There is a feature to enable further layout adjustments to fit the theme
