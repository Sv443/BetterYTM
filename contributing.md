<!-- #region translations -->

### Submitting translations:
Thank you so much for your interest in translating BetterYTM!  
Before submitting a translation, please check on [this document](https://github.com/Sv443/BetterYTM/tree/develop/assets/translations) if the language you want to translate to has already been translated and how many strings are still missing.

<br>

#### Adding translations for a new language:
> [!NOTE]
> 
> **Please make sure you always select the `develop` branch when translating, as the `main` branch is only used for releases.**
To submit a translation, please follow these steps:
1. Copy the contents of the default translation file [`assets/translations/en_US.json`](./assets/translations/en_US.json)
2. Replace the `en_US` part of the file name with the language code and locale code of the language you want to translate to
3. Translate the strings inside the file, while making sure not to change the keys on the left side of the colon and to preserve the placeholders with the format %n (where n is any number starting at 1).  
  If you don't want to finish it in one go, please remove the extra keys before submitting the file. They can always be added back by running the command `pnpm run tr-format -- -p -o=language_LOCALE` (see [this section](#editing-an-existing-translation) for more info).
4. If you like, you may also create a translation for the [`README-summary.md`](./README-summary.md) file for display on the userscript distribution sites  
  Please duplicate the file `README-summary.md` and call it `README-summary-languageCode_localeCode.md` and place it in the [`assets/translations/`](./assets/translations/) folder.
5. If you want to submit a pull request with the translated file:
    1. Duplicate the `en_US.json` file in the folder [`assets/translations/`](./assets/translations/) by keeping the format `languageCode_localeCode.json`
    2. Edit it to your translated version and keep the left side of the colon unchanged
    3. Create the mapping in `assets/locales.json` by copying the English one and editing it (please make sure it's alphabetically ordered)
    4. Add your name to the respective `authors` property in [`assets/locales.json`](./assets/locales.json)
    5. Test your changes by following [this section](#setting-up-the-project-for-local-development), then submit your pull request
6. Alternatively send it to me directly, [see my homepage](https://sv443.net/) for contact info  
  Make sure you also add your language to the contents of [`assets/locales.json`](./assets/locales.json)

<br>

#### Editing an existing translation:
> [!NOTE]
> 
> **Please make sure you always select the `develop` branch when translating, as the `main` branch is only used for releases.**
To edit an existing translation, please follow these steps:
1. Set up the project for local development by following [this section](#setting-up-the-project-for-local-development)  
  Make sure you have forked the repository and cloned your fork instead of cloning the original repository.  
2. Find the file for the language you want to edit in the folder [`assets/translations/`](./assets/translations/)
3. Run the command `pnpm run tr-format -- -p -o=language_LOCALE`, where `language_LOCALE` is the part of the file name before the `.json` extension  
  This will prepare the file for translation by providing the missing keys once in English and once without any value and also formatting the file to have the same structure as the base file `en_US.json`
4. Edit the strings inside the file, while making sure not to change the keys on the left side of the colon and to preserve the placeholders with the format %n (where n is any number starting at 1).
5. Make sure there are no duplicate keys in the file
6. Run the command `pnpm run tr-format -- -o=language_LOCALE` to make sure the file is formatted correctly
7. Test for syntax errors and update translation progress with the command `pnpm run tr-progress`
8. Open the file [`assets/translations/README.md`](./assets/translations/README.md) to see if you're still missing any untranslated keys (you don't have to translate them all, but it would of course be nice)
9. I highly encourage you to test your changes to see if the wording fits into the respective context by following [this section](#setting-up-the-project-for-local-development)
10. Submit your pull request by [clicking here](https://github.com/Sv443/BetterYTM/compare/) and setting the `compare:` dropdown to your fork
11. Check that the CI checks just above the comment box pass and then wait for the pull request to be reviewed and merged

<!-- #region local dev -->

### Setting up the project for local development:
#### Requirements:
1. Have current versions of Node.js, npm and Git installed
2. Install pnpm by running `npm i -g pnpm`
3. Clone this repository  
  If you plan on contributing to the project, please [click here to fork it](https://github.com/Sv443/BetterYTM/fork) and clone your fork instead.  
  Make sure to clone or fork from the `develop` branch since the `main` branch is only used for releases!
4. Switch to the `develop` branch by running `git checkout -b develop` in the project root.  
  Skip this step if you are using your own forked repository.
5. Open a terminal in the project root and run `pnpm i`
6. Copy the file `.env.template` to `.env` and modify the variables inside to your needs.
7. Now you can run `pnpm run dev` to build the userscript and host it on a development server or check out the other commands below

<br>

#### These are the CLI commands available after setting up the project:
- **`pnpm i`**  
  Run once to install dependencies
- **`pnpm run dev`**  
  This is the command you want to use to locally develop and test BetterYTM.  
  It watches for any changes, then rebuilds and serves the userscript on port 8710, so it can be updated live if set up correctly in the userscript manager (see [extras](#extras)).  
  Once it has finished building, a link will be printed to the console. Open it to install the userscript.  
  You can also configure request logging and more in `.env` and `src/tools/serve.ts`, just make sure to restart the dev server after changing anything.  
- **`pnpm run build-prod`**  
  Builds the userscript for production for all hosts with their respective options already set.  
  Outputs the files using a suffix predefined in the `package.json` file.  
  Use this to build the userscript for distribution on all host/CDN platforms.
- **`pnpm run build -- <arguments>`**  
  Builds the userscript with custom options  
  Arguments:  
  - `--config-mode=<value>` - The mode to build in. Can be either `production` or `development` (default)
  - `--config-branch=<value>` - The GitHub branch to target. Can be any branch name, but should be `main` for production and `develop` for development (default)
  - `--config-host=<value>` - The host to build for. Can be either `github` (default), `greasyfork` or `openuserjs`
  - `--config-assetSource=<value>` - Where to get the resource files from. Can be either `local` or `github` (default)
  - `--config-suffix=<value>` - Suffix to add just before the `.user.js` extension. Defaults to an empty string
    
  Shorthand commands:
  - `pnpm run build-prod-base` - Used for building for production, targets the main branch and the public asset source.  
    Sets `--config-mode=production` and `--config-branch=main` and `--config-assetSource=github`
  - `pnpm run build-dev` - Builds a preview version, targeting the develop branch and the public asset source so no local dev environment is needed.  
    Sets `--config-mode=development`, `--config-branch=develop` and `--config-assetSource=github`
  - `pnpm run preview` - Same as `pnpm run build-dev but also starts the dev server for a few seconds so the extension that's waiting for file changes can update the script and assets
- **`pnpm run lint`**  
  Builds the userscript with the TypeScript compiler and lints it with ESLint. Doesn't verify the functionality of the script, only checks for syntax and TypeScript errors!
- **`pnpm run storybook`**  
  Starts Storybook for developing and testing components. After launching, it will automatically open in your default browser.
- **`pnpm run gen-readme`**  
  Updates the README files by inserting different parts of generated sections into them.
- **`pnpm run tr-progress`**  
  Checks all translation files for missing strings and updates the progress table in `assets/translations/README.md`  
  Will also be run automatically after every script build.
- **`pnpm run tr-format -- <arguments>`**  
  Reformats all translation files so they match that of the base file `en_US.json`  
  This includes sorting keys and adding the same empty lines and indentation.
  Arguments:  
  - `--prep` or `-p` - Prepares the files for translation via GitHub Copilot by providing the missing key once in English and once without any value
  - `--only="<value>"` or `-o="<value>"` - Only applies formatting to the files of the specified locales. Has to be a quoted, case-sensitive, comma separated list! (e.g. `-o="fr_FR,de_DE"` or `-o="pt_BR"`)
  - `--include-based` or `-b` - Also includes files which have a base locale specified
- **`pnpm run tr-prep`**  
  Shorthand for `pnpm run tr-format -- --prep` (see above)
- **`pnpm run --silent invisible -- "<command>"`**  
  Runs the passed command as a child process without giving any console output. (`--` and double quotes are required!)  
  Remove `--silent` to see pnpm's info and error messages.
- **`pnpm run node-ts -- <path>`**  
  Runs the TypeScript file at the given path using the regular node binary and the [ts-node ESM loader.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node#node-flags-and-other-tools)  
  Also enables source map support and disables experimental warnings.
- **`pnpm run dep-cruise`**  
  Runs dependency-cruiser to show problems with the dependency tree like circular, missing or orphaned dependencies.
- **`pnpm run dep-graph`**  
  Generates a dependency graph of the project, visually showing the dependencies between files and problems with the dependency tree.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> When you are using npm (as opposed to `pnpm`), read the following carefully:  
> If there are a set of lone `--`, these denote the start of the arguments actually passed to the *script* process and they must be preserved.  
> Any arguments before the double hyphens will be interpreted by *npm*; see the difference in `npm run --silent invisible -- "echo hello"`  
> Here, `--silent` is an argument we pass to npm to make it shut up and `"echo hello"` is an argument we wanna pass to the script that npm ends up invoking.

<br>

#### Extras:
- When using ViolentMonkey, after letting the command `pnpm run dev` run in the background, open [`http://localhost:8710/BetterYTM.user.js`](http://localhost:8710/BetterYTM.user.js) and select the `Track local file` option.  
  This makes it so the userscript automatically updates when the code changes.  
  Note: the tab needs to stay open on Firefox or the script will not update itself.
- To link any local JS file (like a work-in-progress library) in the userscript, add a `"link": "/path/to/script.umd.js"` property to the respective library in [`assets/require.json`](./assets/require.json) (relative or absolute path)  
  As this file will just be injected as-is at build time, make sure you are targeting a UMD or IIFE bundle that exports a variable with the name set by `"global"`.  
  In order to make TypeScript shut up, you will still need to link the library manually with `pnpm link -g /path/to/library_root`

<br>

#### Getting started working on the project:
After setting the project up for local development ([see above](#setting-up-the-project-for-local-development)), you can start working on the project.  
The main files you will be working with are:  
- [`src/index.ts`](./src/index.ts) - The main entry point for the userscript and where all features are initialized
- [`src/interface.ts`](./src/interface.ts) - The file that contains all events and functions that are exposed to plugins
- [`src/types.ts`](./src/types.ts) - The file that contains all types and interfaces that are used throughout the project
- [`src/observers.ts`](./src/observers.ts) - The file that contains all mutation observers that are used to detect changes on the page
- [`src/siteEvents.ts`](./src/siteEvents.ts) - The file that contains all site- and script-specific events that are dispatched by BetterYTM
- [`src/tools`](./src/tools) - The folder that contains all CLI tools and utilities that are used throughout the project
- [`src/components`](./src/components) - The folder that contains all HTML component functions for reusable UI elements

<br>

#### Procedure for specific tasks:
- Adding a new feature:
  1. Add your feature to the `FeatureConfig` type in [`src/types.ts`](./src/types.ts) (after choosing a fitting category for it)
  2. Add your feature and its properties to the `featInfo` object in [`src/features/index.ts`](./src/features/index.ts), under the correct category
  3. Create an async initialization function for your feature in the respective category's file inside the `src/features` folder
  4. Add the init function to the `onDomLoad` function in [`src/index.ts`](./src/index.ts), under the correct "domain guard condition" and category by following the format of the other features
- Adding an asset (image, icon, stylesheet, translation file and misc. other files):
  1. Add the asset to the `assets` folder in the root of the project, under the correct subfolder
  2. Add the asset to the [`assets/resources.json`](./assets/resources.json) file by following the format of the other entries.  
    If the path begins with a slash, it will start at the project root (where package.json is), otherwise it will start at the `assets` folder.
  3. The asset will be immediately available in the userscript after the next build and the `@resource` directive will automatically point at the locally served asset or the GitHub CDN, depending on the build mode.
  4. **When committing, make sure to commit the assets first, then rebuild the userscript and make a second commit.**  
    This needs to be done because the build script at `src/tools/post-build.ts` will use the *previous* commit hash to create version-independent URLs for the assets. These will continue to work in the future, instead of pointing to an ever-changing branch where files could be moved, renamed or deleted at any time.
- Adding a new site event:
  1. Add your event to the `SiteEventsMap` type in [`src/siteEvents.ts`](./src/siteEvents.ts)
  2. Dispatch the event inside `initSiteEvents` in [`src/siteEvents.ts`](./src/siteEvents.ts) or at another point where it is run *independent of the feature configuration* (the only exception being domain-specific events).  
    **Always use the function `emitSiteEvent`** to dispatch the event, so it will automatically be logged and emitted to the plugin interface as well.
- Adding something to the plugin interface:
  - If you want to make a function globally available, simply add it to the `globalFuncs` variable in [`src/interface.ts`](./src/interface.ts) under the correct category.  
    If the function should require a token, create a proxy function at the bottom of the file that checks for the token and then calls the actual function (also see the bottom of the file for examples).
  - If you want to add something else like a class, constant or entire library (as long as its license allows it), add it to the `props` variable inside the function `initInterface` in [`src/interface.ts`](./src/interface.ts)
- Creating a new reusable component:  
  1. Create a new file in the `src/components` folder with a descriptive name
  2. Add a function that takes a single object of properties as an argument (kind of like a React component), and returns an element that extends the `HTMLElement` interface (like what the return value of `document.createElement()` is)
  3. Add a re-export inside the file [`src/components/index.ts`](./src/components/index.ts)
  4. If you want to expose the component to plugins, add it to the `globalFuncs` variable in [`src/interface.ts`](./src/interface.ts) under the category `Components`
  5. Write some documentation for the component inside this file (`contributing.md`), under the [global functions and classes section](#global-functions-and-classes) by following the format of the other documented components.
- Adding a locale:
  1. Add the locale code and info about the locale to the file [`assets/locales.json`](./assets/locales.json) by following the format of the other entries.  
    Please make sure the alphabetical order is kept.
  2. Add a translation file for the locale by following the instructions in the [translations section](#adding-translations-for-a-new-language)
  3. Your locale will be immediately available in the userscript after the next build.

<!-- #region plugin interface -->

### Developing a plugin that interfaces with BetterYTM:
BetterYTM has a built-in interface based on events and exposed global constants and functions that allows other userscripts to benefit from its features.  
If you want your plugin to be displayed in the readme and possibly inside the userscript itself, please [submit an issue using the plugin submission template](https://github.com/Sv443/BetterYTM/issues/new/choose)  
  
<br>

**Strongly recommended knowledge:**
- Intermediate JavaScript knowledge (DOM, events, async functions, fetch, localStorage, etc.)
  - Understanding JS types and reading TypeScript definitions
  - Semantic versioning (for versioning your plugin in the correct format)
- Basic knowledge of userscripts (start on the [GreaseSpot wiki](https://wiki.greasespot.net/Greasemonkey_Manual))
- Reading the file [`license-for-plugins.txt`](./license-for-plugins.txt) to understand the licensing conditions for plugins
  
**Helpful knowledge:**
- TypeScript (for type safety and better autocomplete)
- The source code of BetterYTM  
  This is especially regarding the files `src/interface.ts`, `src/types.ts`, `src/siteEvents.ts` and `src/observers.ts`
- Being on the lookout for pull requests, since they will list new features and changes to the interface that you probably want to prepare for
- This document, as it contains most of the information you need to know about the BetterYTM interface, or at least points you to the places where you can find the actual information
  
<br>

These are the ways to interact with BetterYTM; constants, events and global functions:  
- Static interaction is done through constants that are exposed through the global `BYTM` object, which is available on the `window` object.  
  These read-only properties tell you more about how BetterYTM is currently being run.  
  You can find all properties that are available and their types in the `declare global` block of [`src/types.ts`](src/types.ts)

- Dynamic interaction is done through events that are dispatched on the `window` object.  
  They all have the prefix `bytm:eventName` and are all dispatched with the `CustomEvent` interface, meaning their data can be read using the `detail` property.  
  You can find all events that are available and their types in [`src/interface.ts`](src/interface.ts)  
    
  Additionally BetterYTM has an internal system called SiteEvents. They are dispatched using the format `bytm:siteEvent:eventName`  
  You may find all SiteEvents that are available and their types in [`src/siteEvents.ts`](src/siteEvents.ts)  
  Note that the `detail` property will be an array of the arguments that can be found in the event handler at the top of [`src/siteEvents.ts`](src/siteEvents.ts)

- Another way of dynamically interacting is through global functions, which are also exposed by BetterYTM through the global `BYTM` object.  
  You can find all functions that are available in the `InterfaceFunctions` type in [`src/types.ts`](src/types.ts)  
  There is also a summary with examples [below.](#global-functions)  

- Additionally, the following namespaces expose entire libraries for you that BetterYTM has already loaded in:
  - `unsafeWindow.BYTM.UserUtils` contains all exported members from the [UserUtils library.](https://github.com/Sv443-Network/UserUtils)  
    This library can register listeners for when CSS selectors exist, intercept events, manage persistent user configurations, allow you to modify the DOM more easily and more.
  - `unsafeWindow.BYTM.compareVersions` has all functions from the [compare-versions library.](https://npmjs.com/package/compare-versions)  
    Use it to compare semver-compliant version strings.

All of these interactions require the use of `unsafeWindow`, as the regular window object is pretty sandboxed in userscript managers.  
  
If you need specific events to be added or modified, please [submit an issue.](https://github.com/Sv443/BetterYTM/issues/new/choose)

<br>

<details><summary><b>Static interaction Example <i>(click to expand)</i></b></summary>

#### Example:
```ts
const BYTM = unsafeWindow.BYTM;

console.log(`BetterYTM was built in '${BYTM.mode}' mode`);
console.log(`BetterYTM's locale is set to '${BYTM.locale}'`);
console.log(`BetterYTM's version is '${BYTM.version} #${BYTM.buildNumber}'`);
```

</details>

<br>

<details><summary><b>Dynamic interaction examples <i>(click to expand)</i></b></summary>

#### Basic format:
```ts
window.addEventListener("bytm:eventName", (event) => {
  // can have any type, but usually it's an object or undefined
  const { detail } = event as CustomEvent<{ foo: string }>;

  console.log(detail.foo);
});

// for listening to SiteEvents:
window.addEventListener("bytm:siteEvent:eventName", (event) => {
  // always typed as array / tuple
  const { detail } = event as CustomEvent<[ foo: HTMLElement ]>;

  console.log(detail[0]);
});
```

#### Practical Example:
```ts
// listening to generic events:
window.addEventListener("bytm:ready", () => {
  console.log("The DOM is loaded and all BetterYTM features have been initialized");
});

window.addEventListener("bytm:lyricsLoaded", (event) => {
  const { detail } = event as CustomEvent<{ type: "current" | "queue", artists: string, title: string, url: string }>;

  console.log(`Lyrics URL for "${detail.artists} - ${detail.title}" has been loaded: ${detail.url}`);

  if(detail.type === "current")
    console.log("This is from the currently playing song");
  else
    console.log("This is from a song in the queue");
});

// listening to a SiteEvent:
window.addEventListener("bytm:siteEvent:queueChanged", (event) => {
  const { detail } = event as CustomEvent<[ queueItem: HTMLElement ]>;

  console.log(`The queue has been changed. It now contains ${detail[0].childNodes.length} items`);
});
```

</details>

<br>

**For global function examples [see below.](#global-functions)**

<br><br>

### Shimming for TypeScript without errors & with autocomplete:
In order for TypeScript to not throw errors while creating a plugin, you need to shim the types for BYTM.  
To do this, create a .d.ts file (for example `bytm.d.ts`) and add the following code:
```ts
declare global {
  interface Window {
    BYTM: {
      // add types here
    };
  }
}
```
You may specify all types that you need in this file.  
To find which types BetterYTM exposes, check out the `declare global` block in [`src/types.ts`](src/types.ts)  
You may also just copy it entirely, as long as all the imports also exist in your project.  
An easy way to do this might be to include BetterYTM as a Git submodule, as long as you ***stick to only using type imports***


<br><br>

<!-- #region global interface functions -->

### Global functions and classes:

> #### getResourceUrl()
> Usage:  
> ```ts
> unsafeWindow.BYTM.getResourceUrl(): Promise<string>
> ```
>   
> Description:  
> Returns a `blob:` URL for the specified BYTM resource file.  
> You can find a list of them by looking at the `@resource` directives in the userscript header or in the files `assets/resources.json` and `src/tools/post-build.ts`

> ```
>   
> Description:  
> Returns the unique session ID that is generated on every page load.  
> It should persist between history navigations, but not between page reloads.  
>  
> ⚠️ On privacy-focused browsers or if cookies are disabled, this function will return null since sessionStorage is not available.

> #### addSelectorListener()
> Usage:  
> ```ts
> unsafeWindow.BYTM.addSelectorListener<TElem extends Element>(observerName: ObserverName, selector: string, options: SelectorListenerOptions<TElem>): void
> ```
>   
> Description:  
> Adds a listener to the specified SelectorObserver instance that gets called when the element/s behind the passed selector is/are found.  
> They are immediately checked for and then checked again whenever the part of the DOM tree changes (elements get added or removed) that is observed by that specific SelectorObserver.  
>   
> The instances are chained together in a way that the least specific observer is the parent of the more specific ones.  
> This is done to limit the amount of checks that need to be run, especially on pages with a lot of dynamic content and if `continuous` listeners are used.  
> See the [UserUtils SelectorObserver documentation](https://github.com/Sv443-Network/UserUtils#selectorobserver) for more info and example code.  
>   
> ⚠️ Due to this chained architecture, the selector you pass can only start with an element that is a child of the observer's base element.  
> If you provide a selector that starts higher up or directly on the base element, the listener will never be called.  
> You can check which observer has which base element in the file [`src/observers.ts`](src/observers.ts)  
>   
> Arguments:  
> - `observerName` - The name of the SelectorObserver instance to add the listener to. You can find all available instances and which base element they observe in the file [`src/observers.ts`](src/observers.ts)
> - `selector` - The CSS selector to observe for changes.
> - `options` - The options for the listener. See the [UserUtils SelectorObserver documentation](https://github.com/Sv443-Network/UserUtils#selectorobserver)
>   
> <details><summary><b>Example <i>(click to expand)</i></b></summary>
> 
> ```ts
> // wait for the observers to exist
> unsafeWindow.addEventListener("bytm:observersReady", () => {
>   // use the "lowest" possible SelectorObserver (playerBar) to prevent unnecessary checks
>   // and call the listener as soon as the passed selector is found in the DOM
>   unsafeWindow.BYTM.addSelectorListener<HTMLAnchorElement>("playerBar", "#bytm-player-bar-lyrics-btn", {
>     listener: (lyricsBtnElem) => {

> Usage:
> ```ts
> unsafeWindow.BYTM.onInteraction(
>   element: HTMLElement,
>   callback: (event: MouseEvent | KeyboardEvent) => void,
>   listenerOptions?: AddEventListenerOptions
> ): void
> ```
>
> Description:  
> Adds accessible event listeners to the specified element for button or link-like keyboard and mouse interactions.  
> All events passed to the callback function automatically have the default behavior prevented and stop propagation, meaning no other listener of the same type will be called.  
> For keyboard events this only happens as long as the captured key is a valid interaction key (Space, Enter).  
>   
> Arguments:
> - `element` - The element to add the listeners to
> - `callback` - The function to call when the element is interacted with
> - `listenerOptions` - Optional event listener options (same as the third argument of `addEventListener`, shared between the keyboard and mouse event listeners)
>   
> <details><summary><b>Example <i>(click to expand)</i></b></summary>
> 
> ```ts
> const myButton = document.querySelector("button#myButton");
> 
> unsafeWindow.BYTM.onInteraction(myButton, (event) => {
>   if(event instanceof MouseEvent)
>     console.log("The button was clicked");
>   else if(event instanceof KeyboardEvent)
>     console.log("The button was activated with the keyboard (Space / Enter)");
> }, {
>   // if `once` is set, when either the mouse or keyboard event are triggered once,
>   // the other listener is automatically removed as well to prevent double triggering
>   once: true,
>   // you can pass `capture` to listen in the capture phase (helpful for triggering before other listeners),
>   // or an AbortController's `signal` to be able to abort the listener
> });
> ```

<br>

> #### getVideoTime()
> Usage:  
> ```ts
> unsafeWindow.BYTM.getVideoTime(precision?: number): Promise<number | null>
> ```
>   
> Description:  
> Returns the current video time in seconds, with the given `precision` (2 decimal digits by default).  
> Rounds down if the precision is set to 0. The maximum average available precision on YTM is 6.  
>   
> In case the time can't be determined on YT, mouse movement is simulated to bring up the video time element and read it.  
> In order for that edge case not to throw an error, the function would need to be called in response to a user interaction event (e.g. click) due to the strict automated interaction policy in browsers, otherwise an error can be thrown.  
> Resolves with a number of seconds or `null` if the time couldn't be determined.  
>   
> <details><summary><b>Example <i>(click to expand)</i></b></summary>
> 
> ```ts
> try {
>   // get the video time with 3 decimal digits
>   const videoTime = await unsafeWindow.BYTM.getVideoTime(3);
>   console.log(`The video time is ${videoTime}s`);
> }
> catch(err) {

> ): string
> ```
>   
> Description:  
> Returns the URL to the thumbnail of the video with the specified watch/video ID and quality.  
> If a number is passed, 0 will return a low quality thumbnail and 1-3 will return a low quality frame from the video.  
>   
> Arguments:
> - `watchID` - The watch/video ID of the video to get the thumbnail for
> - `qualityOrIndex` - The quality or index of the thumbnail to get. Quality strings sorted highest resolution first: `maxresdefault` > `sddefault` > `hqdefault` > `mqdefault` > `default`. If no quality is specified, `maxresdefault` (highest resolution) is used.

>   
> Features:
> - Can be opened, closed, mounted, unmounted and destroyed at any time for full control.
> - The dialog is fully responsive and can be used on any screen size, but will not exceed the provided maximum width and height.
> - Scrollability of the body is automatically removed and the body is set to be inert (ignore keyboard input) automatically. Also works with multiple dialogs open at the same time!
> - The dialog can be closed by clicking the background, pressing the escape key or clicking the close button (freely configurable).
> - Features many helper methods and events to make it more flexible and easier to work with.
> - Has an optional small mode for a more compact appearance.
> - If needed, the relatively uniform CSS naming conventions make it easy for the appearance to be overridden by a BetterYTM plugin or userstyle.
>   
> Options properties:
> | Property | Description |
> | :-- | :-- |
> | `id: string` | ID that gets added to child element IDs - has to be unique and conform to HTML ID naming rules! |
> | `width: number` | Maximum and target width of the dialog in pixels |
> | `height: number` | Maximum and target height of the dialog in pixels |
> | `closeOnBgClick?: boolean` | Whether the dialog should close when the background is clicked - defaults to true |

> | `closeBtnEnabled?: boolean` | Whether the close button should be enabled - defaults to true |
> | `destroyOnClose?: boolean` | Whether the dialog should be destroyed when it's closed - defaults to false |
> | `small?: boolean` | Whether the dialog should have a smaller overall appearance - defaults to false |
> | `verticalAlign?: string` | Where the dialog should be anchored vertically ("top", "center" or "bottom") - defaults to "center" |
> | `renderBody: () => HTMLElement │ Promise<HTMLElement>` | Called to render the body of the dialog |
> | `renderHeader?: () => HTMLElement │ Promise<HTMLElement>` | Called to render the header of the dialog - leave undefined for a blank header |
> | `renderFooter?: () => HTMLElement │ Promise<HTMLElement>` | Called to render the footer of the dialog - leave undefined for no footer |
> 
> <br>
> 
> Methods:  
> The methods from the [`NanoEmitter`](#nanoemitter) class are also available here.  
> These are the additional methods that are exclusive to the `BytmDialog` class:  
> - `open(e?: MouseEvent | KeyboardEvent): Promise<void>`  
>   Opens the dialog - also mounts it if it hasn't been mounted yet.  
>   Prevents default action and immediate propagation if an event is passed.  
>   Resolves once the dialog is fully mounted and opened.
> - `close(e?: MouseEvent | KeyboardEvent): void`  
>   Closes the dialog - also unmounts and destroys it if the `destroyOnClose` option is set to true.  
>   Prevents default action and immediate propagation if an event is passed.  
> - `isOpen(): boolean`  
>   Returns true if the dialog is currently open, false if not.
> - `isMounted(): boolean`  
>   Returns true if the dialog is currently mounted, false if not.
> - `mount(): Promise<void>`  
>   Mounts the dialog to the DOM without making it visible - can be called before opening the dialog for the first time to pre-load all elements.  
>   Resolves once the dialog is fully mounted in the DOM.
> - `unmount(): void`  
>   Removes the dialog from the DOM.  
> - `remount(): Promise<void>`  
>   Unmounts and mounts the dialog again.  
>   This can be used to re-render the dialog's contents with new information.  
>   Resolves once the dialog is fully mounted in the DOM.
> - `destroy(): void`  
>   Unmounts and removes the dialog from the DOM and removes all event listeners.  
>   Should be called when the dialog is no longer needed.
> - `static getLastDialogId(): string`  
>   Returns the ID of the last dialog that was opened.  
>   This can be used to check if a dialog is currently open and to get its ID for further use.  
>   Static method usage: `unsafeWindow.BytmDialog.getLastDialogId()` (doesn't need a `new` instance)
> - `static getOpenDialogs(): string[]`  
>   Returns the IDs of all open dialogs, topmost (last opened) first.  
>   Static method usage: `unsafeWindow.BytmDialog.getOpenDialogs()` (doesn't need a `new` instance)
