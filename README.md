# BetterYTM
Userscript that improves [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/)

<br>

## Features:
- Use arrow keys to skip forward or backward by 10 seconds
- Quickly search for the current song's lyrics on genius.com
- Switch between YouTube and YouTube Music on a video by pressing a hotkey (F9 by default)
- Remove the "Upgrade to YT Music Premium" tab in the title bar

<br>

To toggle features on or off, install the userscript, then edit it and look for the big "Settings" banner.  
Below it you will find an object with properties that can be set to `true` or `false` accordingly.  
  
Once this script is more finished, I might add a menu to toggle these more easily.

<br><br>

## Installation:
**Requires a userscript manager extension:**
> Firefox: [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)  
> Chrome: [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
