# BetterYTM
Userscript that improves [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/)

<br>

## Features:
- Use arrow keys to skip forward or backward by 10 seconds
- Switch between YouTube and YouTube Music on a video by pressing a hotkey (F9 by default)
- Disable the "Upgrade" / YT Music Premium tab in the title bar

<br>

To toggle or configure features, install the userscript, then edit it and look for the big "Settings" banner.  
Below it you will find an object with properties that can be set to `true` or `false` accordingly.  
  
Once this script is more finished, I might add a menu to toggle these more easily.

<br><br>
